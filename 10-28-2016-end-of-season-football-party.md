#### --update-- Due to the weather we are moving the freshman party to next Monday November 14, 2016 from 6 pm to 8:30 pm.

We are super appreciate to all the parents and businesses that supported our team this year. I know the boys realize and appreciate your efforts.
 
We are checking to see if anyone has any conflicts for Monday October 31st or would it be better to do Monday November 7th. The party will be from 6pm to 8:30pm. We know that several of you have trick or treat age children and it may not be a good night but we also know this is really more for the boys to go and play and have some food. Please let us know you thoughts. We are looking to have this ASAP due to wrestling and basketball starting soon. Please reply back to me (do not reply to all) if you have a preference. If you do not care than please do not reply.
 
Thanks,
Freshman TDC Reps
