West Moore came to town for an early season scrimmage. Both teams seemed to be happy to get to hit someone on an opposing team. Tempers flared a couple of times but the coaches put an end to it quick. Each team ran a dozen plays on offensive then a dozen defensive plays. The coaches seemed to be trying to get a better look at who could play what position. 

We saw a few good plays on both sides of the ball. A couple of running plays looked like they could have gone the distance had the whisle not been blown. The coaches were blowing the whistle after first contact but that didn't stop a few good hits. The defense also managed to get an interception.

The boys did look a bit rusty but maybe that is to be expected this early. We are all looking forward to seeing the first game of the season on Monday, August 29th at 6pm at Edmond Sante Fe.
