Parents,

 Super Awesome Freshman Parents J We need your help!  Everyone needs to bring at least one item. Please let Louis or I know if you have any questions.

Homecoming is almost here, and the MTDC is gathering donations for our Homecoming Buckets that we fill every year for our football players, managers, and trainers for grades 9th-12th. This can't be done without our parents support. Please ALL 9th-12th grade parents, we are needing enough goodies to fill around 300 buckets. We are needing candy, gum, chips, or any kind of snack so that we can fill these buckets. Please bring your bag of treats to our first Varsity home game this Friday September the 16th to our merchandise trailer, or you can bring your bag to our next meeting which is next Tuesday Sept. 20th at 6:30 pm in the film room. Please help us to make their buckets full.



All of the players will be getting a homecoming bucket given to them by the TDC.  Homecoming is September 23 vs Owasso.

We need donations from parents of snacks, treats, candy, and gatorades.  Donations can be dropped off at the merchandise trailer on Friday night or at the TDC meeting next Tuesday.  Please help if you can.
