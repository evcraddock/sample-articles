Today was the first day in pads for the Mustang Broncos freshman team. Everyone was excited for some contact after spending the first week in shorts and cleats. 

The day started bright and early at 7am. It was early for all of us, most all of the parents showed up with a cup of coffee. We all decided to watch from the vistors side to avoid the sun which was beginning to peak over the horizon. Everyone seems excited that its football season again. It's kind of hard to believe that our boys are in highschool already, but here we are. 

We weren't the only ones dragging this morning. I doubt many of these boys have been awake before 7am all summer. Tired as they were, they were definitely ready to put on the pads and hit. 

After stretching, the players huddled up with their position coaches and went over their plays. The coaches then split them up into three teams, red, white and black. After doing a quick run through with each group, they began the scrimmage. There was limited contact but I saw a few good hits before the whistle was blown. At this point, I think the coaches are still trying to get a feel for who is ready to pay where. 

They were a bit rusty, but considering it was the first day in pads, I think the scrimmage went well. It should be a great season.

Their next practice is on monday at 6pm.
