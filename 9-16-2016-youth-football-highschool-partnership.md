Parents of youth football players.
I've got some exciting news.  The current Mustang high school athletic department and the youth football board have been working together to come up with some partnerships.  The following plan is good for every home game this year and should continue from this point forward. Please read the following and talk to your son's youth coach:

 
Mustang Little League Football players are welcome to attend all home high school football games for free.  They will have to wear their little league team jersey to get in the event free.  Two coaches will also be allowed free admittance with the team.   All other adults will need to pay admission to the game.   They will need to identify themselves as a little league coach to the ticket booth attendant.  Parents can park in the student parking lot (the main parking lot just north of the field).  You can enter at the northeast or northwest ticket booth.  I would recommend the northwest booth.  It typically has a smaller line compared to the other booth.
 
At 6:45 the little league players will need to be on the north ramp (where the high school players enter the field).  We ask that parents stay in this area and do not enter the field.
The little league players will escort the high school team on to the field.
The little league players will be assisted by the cheerleaders to take their places in front of the tunnel (the inflatable bronco tunnel on the south end of the field)
They will be part of the group that leads the team on to the field.  
Cheerleaders and school staff will escort all students back to the north ramp where the parents will meet up with their child.
 
We hope everyone has a great time cheering on the BRONCOS!

Spread the word.
